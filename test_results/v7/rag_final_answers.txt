QUERY: AILA_Q1
BASED ON: C1405, C1088, C2638
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1405, C1088, and C2638, I will provide an answer to your query.

The user's query is about the legal context surrounding the termination of services by the Bank. The key issue appears to be whether the Bank's action was in accordance with natural justice principles and whether the appellant was given a fair opportunity to respond before his services were terminated.

In this context, it is relevant to consider the precedents set forth in documents C1405, C1088, and C2638.

Document C1405 (State Bank of India v Samaredra Kishore Endow) deals with a disciplinary inquiry conducted by the State Bank of India against one of its employees. The charges against the employee included submitting false receipts and making false claims for reimbursement. In this case, the Supreme Court held that the bank's action in conducting a disciplinary inquiry was justified, but it also emphasized the importance of following natural justice principles during such inquiries.

Document C1088 (State Bank of India and others v Samarendra Kishore Endow and another) is similar to document C1405, as it also deals with a disciplinary inquiry conducted by the State Bank of India against one of its employees. In this case, the Supreme Court held that the bank's action in conducting a disciplinary inquiry was justified, but it also emphasized the importance of following natural justice principles during such inquiries.

Document C2638 (B. D. Gupta v State Of Haryana) deals with a disciplinary proceeding under the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952. In this case, the Supreme Court held that the government's action in conducting a disciplinary inquiry was justified, but it also emphasized the importance of following natural justice principles during such inquiries.

Based on these precedents, it appears that the Bank's action in terminating the appellant's services without giving him a fair opportunity to respond may have been in violation of natural justice principles. The Bank's failure to provide the appellant with an opportunity to explain his alleged negligent conduct before terminating his services may have resulted in a denial of procedural fairness.

In light of these precedents, it is possible that the High Court's decision dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant was incorrect. The High Court's decision may have been influenced by the Bank's argument that the termination of the appellant's services was justified due to his alleged misconduct. However, this argument may not have taken into account the importance of following natural justice principles during disciplinary inquiries.

Therefore, it is possible that the appeal filed by the appellant against the High Court's decision may be meritorious and deserving of consideration.

QUERY: AILA_Q2
BASED ON: C2639, C1227, C247
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2639, C1227, and C247, it is clear that the issues raised by the appellant's resignation as Cabinet Minister due to disparaging remarks made by the Appellate Judge are not directly addressed in these documents. However, we can draw some general principles from these judgments.

In document C2639 (Indian Farmers Fertilizer Co-operative Limited v Bhadra Products), the Supreme Court of India held that an award delivered by an Arbitrator, which decides the issue of limitation, cannot be said to be an interim award and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to proceed further under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

In document C1227 (Chatt Ram v State of Haryana), the Supreme Court of India upheld the conviction and sentence passed on the accused for offences u/ss. 467 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code. The judgment highlights the importance of evidence in establishing a prosecution's case.

In document C247 (Chandrakant Ganpat Sovitkar and another v State of Maharashtra), the Supreme Court of India confirmed the conviction and sentence passed on the accused for offences u/ss. 161 read with Section 34, I.P.C. and S. 5(2) read with S. 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

In light of these judgments, it appears that the issues raised by the appellant's resignation are not directly addressed in these documents. However, we can draw some general principles from these judgments. For instance, the importance of evidence in establishing a prosecution's case (document C1227) may be relevant to the present appeal. Additionally, the principle that an award delivered by an Arbitrator cannot be said to be an interim award and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to proceed further under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (document C2639) may not be directly applicable to the present appeal.

Therefore, based on the analysis of documents C2639, C1227, and C247, it appears that the issues raised by the appellant's resignation are not directly addressed in these documents. However, we can draw some general principles from these judgments that may be relevant to the present appeal.

QUERY: AILA_Q3
BASED ON: C1462, C735, C1915
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1462, C735, and C1915, I will provide an answer to your query.

The appeal arises from the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court dated 6th June, 1988, whereby the learned Single Judge declined to quash the prosecution of the petitioner. The petitioner has been prosecuted for selling adulterated supari on the basis of a certificate issued by the Director of Central Food Laboratory showing that the article of food purchased from the accused contained 2000 mgs/kg saccharin and that the sample does not conform to the standard rules.

In this context, it is relevant to consider the precedents set in documents C1462 and C735. In State of Punjab v Charan Singh (C1462), the Supreme Court held that when a police officer is accused of misconduct or criminal offense, the procedure for departmental enquiry as laid down in Rule 16.38 of the Punjab Police Rules must be followed.

Similarly, in Dr. Balwant Singh v Commissioner of Police and others (C735), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of following the procedures laid down by law when dealing with complaints against police officers.

In light of these precedents, it is clear that the prosecution of the petitioner for selling adulterated supari must be based on a thorough investigation and compliance with the relevant procedures. The Single Judge's decision to decline quashing the prosecution was correct in this regard.

As for document C1915, while it does not directly relate to the present case, it highlights the importance of following procedures when dealing with complaints against government officials or employees. This precedent may be relevant in considering the petitioner's appeal against the acquittal of accused Nos. 2 and 3.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of documents C1462, C735, and C1915, it is clear that the prosecution of the petitioner for selling adulterated supari must be based on a thorough investigation and compliance with the relevant procedures. The Single Judge's decision to decline quashing the prosecution was correct in this regard.

QUERY: AILA_Q4
BASED ON: C2794, C1381, C2824
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2794, C1381, and C2824, I would say that the legal context relevant to this query is as follows:

The Petitioner's claim for quashing the proceedings against him is not tenable. The High Court's order rejecting his petition and declining to quash Complaint Case No. 307 initiated against him was proper.

In Document C2794 (Mohammed Shamim and Others v Smt. Nahid Begum and Another), the Supreme Court held that a settlement agreement can be a valid consideration for quashing a First Information Report (FIR). However, in this case, there is no evidence of a similar settlement agreement between the parties.

In Document C1381 (Preeti Gupta and another v State of Jharkhand and another), the Supreme Court held that a complaint under Section 498-A IPC cannot be quashed solely on the ground that the complainant has returned to her parental home. The court also noted that the complainant's allegations of physical assault and demand for dowry were not frivolous.

In Document C2824 (Sada Ram v State of Haryana), the Supreme Court held that a right of private defence can be pleaded as a justification for an act that would otherwise constitute an offence. However, this case is distinguishable from the present one, as it involves a claim of self-defence rather than allegations of dowry harassment.

In light of these precedents, I conclude that the Petitioner's petition to quash the proceedings against him should be rejected. The Respondent No.2 has made serious allegations of physical and mental torture, including demands for additional dowry, which warrant investigation and prosecution under the relevant laws.

QUERY: AILA_Q5
BASED ON: C2861, C2290, C190
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2861, C2290, and C190, I will provide my answer.

The appeal is preferred against the judgment dated 19.8.2011 passed by the High Court, whereby the High Court partly allowed the appeal filed by the appellants thereby confirming the conviction of the appellants with certain modifications.

To determine the correctness of the impugned judgment, we need to examine the relevant provisions and precedents. 

In Abdul Waheed v State of Uttar Pradesh (C2861), the Supreme Court held that when a person exercises his right of private defence, he must do so in a reasonable manner and not exceed the limits of self-defence. The court also emphasized that the accused's plea of self-defence should be considered along with other evidence to determine whether the accused acted reasonably.

In State of Uttar Pradesh and others v Madhav Prasad Sharma (C2290), the Supreme Court reiterated that when a disciplinary proceeding is initiated, the authority must follow the due process of law and provide adequate opportunities to the respondent to defend himself. The court also emphasized that the Disciplinary Authority's findings should be based on evidence and not mere suspicion.

In Dayanand Ramkrishna Shet v State of Karnataka (C190), the Supreme Court held that when a person is tried for an offence, the prosecution must establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The court also emphasized that the trial court's findings should be based on evidence and not mere speculation.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the appellants' appeal against the impugned judgment may have some merit. Therefore, I recommend that the appeal be allowed and the conviction of the appellants be set aside or modified to reflect a more reasonable sentence in light of their plea of self-defence.

QUERY: AILA_Q6
BASED ON: C1796, C2771, C1529
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1796, C2771, and C1529, I will provide an answer to your query.

In the context of the given scenario, it is essential to consider the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in various judgments. One such principle is that a person has the right to private defense when they are attacked and can cause injuries in the process of protecting themselves (Mohd. Anwar and another v State of Delhi, C2771).

In this case, it appears that P4 was attacked by P2 and tried to defend himself with a knife and desi katta. Although P4's actions may have been excessive, he had the right to private defense when faced with an attack.

Another relevant principle is that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt (Hem Raj and others v State of Haryana, C1529). In this scenario, it seems that the prosecution has established that P4 was attacked by P2 and tried to defend himself. However, the extent of P4's injuries and his subsequent actions in self-defense are crucial factors to consider.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of documents C1796, C2771, and C1529, it appears that P4 had the right to private defense when attacked by P2. The prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the extent of P4's injuries and his subsequent actions in self-defense are crucial factors to consider.

Please note that this answer is based on the information provided and may not be a comprehensive or definitive analysis of the scenario.

QUERY: AILA_Q7
BASED ON: C2431, C683, C1956
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2431, C683, and C1956, the following observations can be made:

The main issue in this appeal is the modification of sentence by the High Court. The appellant was convicted of misappropriating a sum of Rs. 3851.60 and altering/mutilating the cash book (Ex. 4) with intent to defraud the government.

In Ganeshmal Jashraj v Govt. Of Gujarat And Anr. [C2431], the Supreme Court held that when a trial court imposes a sentence, it must be in accordance with the provisions of the law and not lightly or arbitrarily. The court emphasized that the trial court has the discretion to impose a sentence, but it is bound by the mandatory requirements of the law.

In Prem Chand and Another v State of Haryana [C683], the Supreme Court reiterated that when a trial court imposes a sentence, it must be in accordance with the provisions of the law. The court also emphasized that the trial court has the discretion to impose a sentence, but it is bound by the mandatory requirements of the law.

In Arun Garg v State of Punjab and Another [C1956], the Supreme Court held that when a trial court imposes a sentence, it must be in accordance with the provisions of the law. The court also emphasized that the trial court has the discretion to impose a sentence, but it is bound by the mandatory requirements of the law.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the High Court's modification of sentence was not in accordance with the provisions of the law. Therefore, this appeal may have merit and should be considered by the Supreme Court.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q8
BASED ON: C2638, C1915, C403
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2638, C1915, and C403, I will provide an answer to your query.

The appeal before the Supreme Court is against the judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of the High Court (Aurangabad Bench), which dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants and affirmed their conviction and sentence of 7 years RI imposed thereunder.

To determine the legal context, we need to analyze the relevant statutes and precedents. Document C2638 refers to a case where an Enquiry Officer was appointed as late as October 1957, whereas document C1915 mentions the Vth Pay Commission, which revised pay scales of Rs.940-1660 to Rs.1640-2900 with effect from January 1, 1996.

Document C403 is relevant in understanding the concept of "accidental death report" and the procedure followed by the police in such cases. The document mentions that a person came from village V1 on a motorcycle and informed PW.1 P2 that P1 was unwell. This information led to an accidental death report being lodged at 9.00 p.m. on 15 September 1991 at the police station.

In light of these documents, it appears that the appellants' appeal is against their conviction and sentence for the murder of P1, which was affirmed by the High Court. The prosecution's case is based on the fact that P1 was treated poorly by her husband and mother-in-law after marriage, and she eventually died under suspicious circumstances.

To determine the legal context, we need to analyze the relevant statutes and precedents. The Indian Penal Code (IPC) would be relevant in understanding the charges framed against the appellants. Section 302 IPC deals with murder, whereas Section 201 IPC deals with causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to conceal commission of offence.

The Supreme Court's judgments in documents C2638 and C1915 provide guidance on the procedure to be followed in disciplinary proceedings and pay scales for government employees, respectively. Document C403 provides insight into the concept of "accidental death report" and the procedure followed by the police in such cases.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of documents C2638, C1915, and C403, it appears that the appellants' appeal is against their conviction and sentence for murder, which was affirmed by the High Court. The relevant statutes and precedents include the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as Supreme Court judgments on disciplinary proceedings, pay scales, and accidental death reports.

QUERY: AILA_Q9
BASED ON: C1643, C2688, C10
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1643, C2688, and C10...

The complainant P1 filed a Special Leave Petition in this court seeking leave to appeal against the judgment dated 6th April, 1993 of the High Court. The incident for which these accused were charged is the murder of P2, son of the complainant P1 (appellant) on 13th June, 1982.

As per the case of the prosecution, the complainant along with his son P2 (deceased) was getting his maize field weeded through the help of a few labourers on the morning of 13th June, 1982. His real brother P3 came on the spot and forbade the complainant from doing so.

The High Court dismissed the appeal in limine making the following observations: "As regards merits, it is clear from the perusal of the record that the witness named in the fardbayan have not been examined by the prosecution and also that the witnesses examined in Court were examined by the police after eight months from the date of occurrence. It is also clear that the Investigating Office of the case has not been examined. Therefore, there are no merits. Further the appeal is barred by limitation also, which cannot be considered."

Against the said judgment of the High Court, the complainant filed a Special Leave Petition in this Court. Leave was granted.

In the context of the documents provided, specifically Document C1643 (Mahavir Prashad Gupta and Another v State of National Capital Territory of Delhi and Others), it is relevant to note that the Supreme Court has held that "there are sufficien" grounds for taking action against the petitioners. This judgment may be relevant in considering the merits of the appeal.

Document C2688 (Suneet Gupta v Anil Triloknath Sharma and Others) may also be relevant in understanding the concept of "abuse and excess of authority conferred by law" which was mentioned in the High Court's order dismissing the appeal.

Document C10 (Prabhakaran Nair, Etc. v State Of Tamil Nadu And Ors.) may not be directly applicable to this case, but it highlights the importance of considering the merits of a case and the need for sufficient grounds for taking action against an accused person.

In light of these documents, I would recommend that the court consider the merits of the appeal, including the investigation into the murder of P2, and whether there are sufficient grounds to uphold the acquittal of the accused persons. Additionally, the court may wish to consider whether the appeal is barred by limitation, as mentioned in the High Court's order dismissing the appeal.

QUERY: AILA_Q10
BASED ON: C2155, C2879, S21
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2155, C2879, and S21, I will answer your query.

The appellants, along with P1 son of P2, were jointly tried in the court of Additional Sessions Judge on charges including rioting punishable under Section 147 of the Indian Penal Code. The trial court convicted them all for the offence of rioting and sentenced each to rigorous imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 501-, in default, rigorous imprisonment for two weeks.

The order convicting them all concludes thus: "All the five accused are convicted for the offence of rioting punishable and each is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for the period of six months and to a fine of Rs. 501-, in default, rigorous imprisonment for two weeks for that offence. Accused shall surrender to their bail."

The four appellants before us jointly appealed to the High Court by one memorandum of appeal. The learned judge admitted the appeal only on behalf of P1 and dismissed in limine the appeal on behalf of the other four appellants.

In this context, it is relevant to consider the precedents set forth in documents C2155 and C2879.

Document C2155 (Noor Mohammad Mohd. Yusuf Momin v State Of Maharashtra) deals with a case where an accused was jointly tried with three others for murder and other charges. The Supreme Court held that when multiple accused are jointly tried, the appeal of one or more of them does not automatically render the appeals of all the co-accused infructuous.

Document C2879 (BHARWAD MEPA DANA and ANOTHER v STATE of BOMBAY) is a case where 12 persons were tried together for various offences under the Indian Penal Code, including murder. The Supreme Court held that when multiple accused are jointly tried, the conviction of some and acquittal of others do not necessarily render the appeal of one or more of them infructuous.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the High Court's order dismissing in limine the appeal on behalf of the four appellants before us may be open to challenge. The correctness of this order is the only point which concerns this Court in the present appeal by special leave.

Therefore, based on the analysis of documents C2155, C2879, and S21, it appears that the High Court's order dismissing the appeal on behalf of the four appellants before us may be open to challenge.

QUERY: AILA_Q11
BASED ON: C1512, C2397, S97
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1512, C2397, and S97, I will provide an answer to your query.

The detenu P1, a French national, was employed as Airport Manager by A1 in L1. He arrived at International Airport, L2 by an A1 flight on September 20, 1981, and passed through the green channel indicating he had no dutiable goods to declare to the Customs Authorities. When questioned about the contents of two suitcases and other packages carried by him, his reply led to the inspection of the baggage which resulted in the recovery of watch parts weighing 4 1/2 Kgs, in 8 packages.

The Government made an order of detention on December 16, 1981, with a view to preventing P1 from smuggling goods. The grounds of detention referred to the smuggling of the watch parts and two wrist-watches. P1 filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the High Court at L2.

The High Court rejected P1's contention that the detention order was mala fide, having been served to prevent the Magistrate from passing an order on the application for leaving India. The Court held that even though this is the first time P1 was found indulging in smuggling activities and a prosecution might have been launched, taking into account all relevant materials, satisfaction on the likelihood of repetition of smuggling activities in future seemed real.

P1 filed a petition for special leave against the judgment of the High Court as also a writ petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The additional grounds urged by P1 were not raised before the High Court and did not press any of the contentions which were canvassed before the High Court, but urged three other contentions.

The first contention was that the Detaining Authority did not consider the representation and thereby violated constitutional guarantee. However, this contention is not supported by the documents provided. The second contention was that even if P1 is alleged to have made a confessional statement, the same was retracted before the detention order was made, and yet there is nothing to show that the detaining authority took into consideration the fact that the confession was retracted. This contention is also not supported by the documents provided.

The third contention was that in any view of the matter, the fact that as the confessional statement was retracted by P1, the retraction ought to have been sent to the Advisory Board. This contention is also not supported by the documents provided.

In Majendran Langeswaran v State (NCT of Delhi) and another (Document ID: C2397), it was held that a judge should ask himself the question how, if the makers of the Act had themselves come across this ruck in the texture of it, they would have straightened it out? He must then do as they would have done. A judge must not alter the material of which the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out the creases.

In Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board and others v A. Rajappa and Others (Document ID: C1512), it was held that when a defect appears in an enactment, a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of Parliament and then he must supplement the written words so as to give 'force and life' to the intention of legislature.

In the Constitution of India (Document ID: S97), it is defined that "Article" means an Article of this Constitution, and "clause" means a clause of the Article in which the expression occurs.

Based on these documents, I conclude that P1's contentions are not supported by the evidence provided. The detention order was made with a view to preventing P1 from smuggling goods, and the High Court rejected his petition for habeas corpus.

QUERY: AILA_Q12
BASED ON: C1632, C2858, C499
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1632, C2858, and C499...

The petitioner's detention under the order dated June 5, 1990 passed by the District Magistrate is valid as it was made with a view to preventing him from doing any such work which is prejudicial for the maintenance of public order.

In John Martin v State of West Bengal (Document ID: C1632), the Supreme Court held that an order of detention under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 can be made if the detaining authority has reasonable grounds to believe that the person's activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community.

Similarly, in Binod Bihari Mahato v State of Bihar and Others (Document ID: C2858), the Supreme Court held that an order of detention can be made if the detaining authority has reasonable grounds to believe that the person's activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.

In Ramesh Yadav v District Magistrate, Etah and Others (Document ID: C499), the Supreme Court held that an order of detention under Section 3(2) of the National Security Act can be made if the detaining authority has reasonable grounds to believe that the person's activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.

In this case, the grounds of detention furnished to the detenu stated that the brutal murder committed by the petitioner along with his companion on February 12, 1990 had created a feeling of insecurity in public in general and among doctors in particular. The grounds also stated that the petitioner was trying to get bail in another criminal case and his bail application was under consideration.

Therefore, based on the analysis of these documents, it can be concluded that the petitioner's detention is valid as it was made with a view to preventing him from doing any such work which is prejudicial for the maintenance of public order.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q13
BASED ON: C1684, C548, C1325
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1684, C548, and C1325, it appears that the respondent's employment as a constable in the Police Force of L1 was terminated with one month's notice. The termination order was allegedly made due to the respondent being an ex-convict for theft.

In Kailash Chandra v Union of India (C1684), the Supreme Court held that the constitutional guarantee of protection of public servants applies to temporary as well as permanent public servants. The court observed that even if an order merely terminating employment is passed, it is open to the court to ascertain whether the order was intended to be one imposing penalty.

In Shri Harendra Nath Borah v State Of Assam (C548), the Supreme Court held that the evidence of eye witnesses cannot be relied upon solely due to delay in lodging the FIR. The court also observed that no sanction was required under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the prosecution.

In K. Rajamani v State of Tamil Nadu (C1325), the Supreme Court held that the evidence of witnesses can be relied upon even if there is delay in lodging the FIR. The court also observed that no sanction was required under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the prosecution.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the termination order made by the Superintendent of Police, L2, was invalid as it infringed the constitutional guarantee of protection of public servants. The respondent's employment should be reinstated with retrospective effect, and the Chief Commissioner should not enforce the said order.

Therefore, I recommend that the appeal be allowed, and the respondent's employment be reinstated with retrospective effect.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q14
BASED ON: C1148, C2656, C2817
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1148, C2656, and C2817, I would like to address your query regarding P1's appeal against the judgment and order dated 17.10.2005 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court.

It appears that P1 is seeking to challenge the acquittal of Accused No. 1 by the High Court, while all other accused persons were convicted for committing the murder of P5. The relevant provisions of law that may be applicable in this case are Sections 143, 148, 307, 302, and 504 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

In Gurunath Donkappa Keri And Others v State Of Karnataka (Document ID: C1148), the Supreme Court held that the trial court's judgment convicting accused persons for various offences under the IPC was correct. The court observed that the prosecution had established the guilt of the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt.

Similarly, in Sat Narain v State of Haryana (Document ID: C2656), the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence of the accused person for committing murder and causing injuries to others during a quarrel between family members.

In State of Uttar Pradesh v Babu and Others (Document ID: C2817), the Supreme Court held that the High Court's acquittal of the accused persons was incorrect, as the prosecution had established their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The court observed that the trial court's judgment convicting the accused persons for various offences under the IPC was correct.

In light of these precedents, it appears that P1 may have a strong case to challenge the acquittal of Accused No. 1 by the High Court. However, further analysis and examination of the evidence presented in this case would be necessary to determine the merits of P1's appeal.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q15
BASED ON: C2239, C2694, C2779
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2239, C2694, and C2779, it is evident that the appellants in this case have filed an appeal as of right against their conviction by the High Court.

The gist of the case against them is that all five accused formed themselves into an unlawful assembly on the evening of 24-10-1985 and lay in ambush waiting for P1 (deceased) to come through the road. The most important witness in this case is PW 10 (P2), who sustained eight injuries, some of which were serious, during the occurrence.

The trial court did not place reliance on the evidence of PW 10 (P2) primarily because her evidence did not agree with the testimony of PW 11 (JoP4). However, it must be pointed out that JoP4 was cited as an eyewitness and he turned hostile. The High Court has rightly repelled the trial court's version and placed reliance on the evidence of PW 10 (P2).

In the context of this case, it is relevant to cite Section 379 CrPC read with Section 2 of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act. It is also pertinent to refer to the judgments in Jamna v State Of U.P., Dajya Moshya Bhil and Others v State of Maharashtra, and Vishvas Aba Kurane v State of Maharashtra.

In Jamna v State Of U.P., it was held that a court cannot possibly hold that a witness would not have witnessed the occurrence if she herself sustained as many as eight injuries, some of which were serious, during the occurrence. Similarly, in Dajya Moshya Bhil and Others v State of Maharashtra, it was observed that a hostile witness's stance in the Court should not be given undue importance.

In Vishvas Aba Kurane v State of Maharashtra, it was held that when a court is faced with conflicting evidence, it must carefully evaluate the credibility of each witness and the reliability of their testimony. In this case, the High Court has rightly placed reliance on the evidence of PW 10 (P2) and rejected the trial court's version.

In light of these judgments, it is submitted that the appellants' appeal should be allowed and their conviction by the High Court set aside.

QUERY: AILA_Q16
BASED ON: C2386, C16, C428
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2386, C16, and C428, I will provide an answer to your query.

The appellant P1 is convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge by judgment and order dated 5th/9th August, 1991, and was sentenced to death subject to confirmation by the High Court. The High Court set aside the death penalty and sentenced the appellant to suffer imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- in default thereof to undergo R.I. for 18 months.

The prosecution version as stated by P.W.1 is that he was a resident of Delhi and was dealing with umbrellas; he had two wives, P2 and P3, and several children. There was a dispute between him and his wife P2 regarding the house where his first wife resided earlier before she shifted. The appellant went to Tis Hazari on 17th October, 1988, along with his son-in-law P10 and met his counsel who advised him to come back the next day. At about 6:00 P.M., when he was sleeping in the house, he woke up on hearing a quarrel between P8 (daughter of P2) and P3. He slapped P8 and asked her to desist from abusing P3. After this, the appellant and P7 came into the house, P7 went inside the room along with P8, and then came out with a dagger. P7 abused him and stabbed him on his left eye; he fell down. At that time, P3 intervened and protested, saying as to why he was beating his handicapped father. The appellant snatched away the dagger from P7 and started stabbing P3 repeatedly. At that stage, his daughter P9 intervened and asked the appellant as to why he was stabbing P3. P7 stated that she was the root of all troubles, so the appellant started stabbing P9 at her abdomen, neck, and other parts of her body. After some time, when persons collected outside, the appellant ran away. Within minutes, P3 and P9 died at the spot.

The High Court has rightly arrived at the conclusion that the accused is guilty for the offence for which he is charged. The prosecution witnesses, particularly P.W.1, P.W.2, and P.W.4, have unequivocally deposed that both the deceased persons were killed by the appellant by inflicting dagger blows.

In this context, it is relevant to refer to the following precedents:

* In Hari Shankers v State of Uttar Pradesh (Document ID: C2386), the Supreme Court held that when a prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence, the court must carefully examine each piece of evidence and ensure that there are no inconsistencies or contradictions in the evidence.
* In Earabhadrappa Alias Krishnappa v State of Karnataka (Document ID: C16), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of considering the totality of the circumstances when evaluating the evidence presented by the prosecution.
* In Geetha v State of Karnataka (Document ID: C428), the Supreme Court highlighted the need to carefully reappreciate the evidence and consider all the incriminating circumstances before arriving at a conclusion.

In light of these precedents, it is clear that the High Court has correctly evaluated the evidence presented by the prosecution and arrived at the conclusion that the appellant is guilty of the offence for which he was charged.

QUERY: AILA_Q17
BASED ON: C2858, C2616, C1642
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2858, C2616, and C1642, I would like to provide an answer to your query.

The petitioner is challenging an order of detention dated 1st March, 2001, which was passed after a lapse of about seven months from the alleged incident. The detaining authority has failed to apply its mind as regards the issue of unreasonable delay in passing the order of detention.

In this context, it is relevant to refer to the judgments in documents C2858 and C2616. In Binod Bihari Mahato v State of Bihar and Others (Document ID: C2858), the Supreme Court held that an order of detention must be passed within a reasonable time from the alleged incident, and any delay beyond a reasonable period would render the order invalid.

Similarly, in Union of India and Others v Muneesh Suneja (Document ID: C2616), the Supreme Court observed that when there is unreasonable delay in passing an order of detention, it raises a doubt about the bona fides of the detaining authority. The court also held that the burden lies on the detaining authority to show that the delay was reasonable and justified.

In Abdul Nasar Adam Ismail Through Abdul Basheer Adam Ismail v The State Of Maharashtra & Ors. (Document ID: C1642), the Supreme Court reiterated the principle that an order of detention must be passed within a reasonable time from the alleged incident, and any delay beyond a reasonable period would render the order invalid.

In light of these judgments, it is clear that the detaining authority has failed to apply its mind as regards the issue of unreasonable delay in passing the order of detention. The petitioner's contention that the incident of 24th July, 2000 had become stale and irrelevant by the time the order of detention was passed on 1st March, 2001 is supported by the judgments cited above.

Therefore, based on the analysis of documents C2858, C2616, and C1642, I conclude that the petitioner's challenge to the order of detention dated 1st March, 2001 has merit.

QUERY: AILA_Q18
BASED ON: C188, S38, C1023
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C188, S38, and C1023, I will provide a brief answer to your query.

The appeals involve a pure question of law as to whether an award by which residue assets of a partnership firm are distributed amongst the partners on dissolution of the partnership firm requires registration.

In the context of this case, it is essential to consider the relevant statutes and precedents. Section 38 of the Code (S38) provides that an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law.

In Debabrata Gupta v S. K. Ghosh (C1023), the Supreme Court held that where a partnership deed provides for the distribution of residue assets amongst the partners on dissolution of the partnership firm, such an award requires registration under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932.

Applying these precedents to the present case, it is clear that the award by which residue assets of the partnership firm are distributed amongst the partners on dissolution of the partnership firm requires registration. Therefore, the trial Court's decision that the unregistered award was inadmissible in evidence is correct.

In light of this analysis, I conclude that the appeals should be dismissed, and the trial Court's decision upholding the requirement for registration of the award should be upheld.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q19
BASED ON: C358, C2737, C2209
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C358, C2737, and C2209, I will provide an answer to your query.

The appellants have appealed against the judgment and order dated 31.08.2012 passed by the High Court whereby the High Court has allowed the appeal filed by the State and convicted all the appellants and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- each.

In this context, it is important to note that the Supreme Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v Raj Bahadur Singh and Another (C358) has held that "the trial court's conclusion that the evidence of PW-4 and PW-5 was full of contradictions on material particulars and as such the testimony of these witnesses did not inspire any confidence" is a finding which requires careful scrutiny and evaluation.

Similarly, in Veerla Satyanarayana v State of Andhra Pradesh (C2737), the Supreme Court has emphasized that "the prosecution's case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt" and that "the trial court's appreciation of evidence should not be disturbed unless it is found to be manifestly erroneous or unreasonable".

In Shaik China Brahmam v State Of A.P (C2209), the Supreme Court has reiterated that "the trial court's findings on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great weight and should not be lightly interfered with" unless there is a clear error or misdirection.

Considering these precedents, it appears that the High Court's judgment convicting all the five accused and sentencing them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- each may require careful scrutiny and evaluation on the grounds of contradictions in the evidence of PW-4 and PW-5 and the failure to inspire confidence in their testimony.

Therefore, I would recommend that the appellants' appeal be allowed and the conviction set aside, as the High Court's judgment appears to be based on an error of law or a misdirection of fact.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q20
BASED ON: C2824, C2371, C552
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2824, C2371, and C552, I provide my answer as follows:

The appeal before us is directed against the judgment rendered by the High Court confirming the conviction of the appellant for the offences punishable under Section 302 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The prosecution version leading to the trial of the appellant is that on the intervening night of April 7-8, 2002, the appellant went to the house of the deceased with an intention to end his life and hacked and attempted to kill him by inflicting severe injuries.

The High Court, while confirming the judgment passed by the Principal Sessions Judge, relied upon the evidence of PW-3 and PW-4. Both courts below found that the appellant attacked the deceased with a sharp-edged weapon resulting in his death. The courts also found that the appellant attempted to kill PW-3 by inflicting severe injuries on her body.

In this context, it is pertinent to consider the Supreme Court's judgment in Sada Ram v State of Haryana (C2824), where the court held that the prosecution must prove the accused's intention to cause death or grievous hurt. The court also emphasized that the mere fact that the accused caused serious injuries does not necessarily imply an intention to kill.

Furthermore, in M.C. Gupta and Mohan Lal Gupta v Central Bureau Of Investigation (C2371), the Supreme Court reiterated that the prosecution must establish the accused's intention to cause death or grievous hurt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also highlighted the importance of considering the totality of circumstances surrounding the occurrence to determine the accused's intention.

In D.D. Suri v Union of India and Another (C552), the Supreme Court emphasized the need for a careful analysis of the evidence to determine the accused's intention. The court also stressed that the prosecution must prove the accused's intention to cause death or grievous hurt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Considering these precedents, it is essential to re-examine the evidence presented in this case and assess whether the High Court correctly applied the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q21
BASED ON: C113, C663, C2068
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C113, C663, and C2068, it appears that the respondent was appointed as a daily-rated worker in the Horticulture Department of the State on 3.9.1980. The respondent prayed for regularization as a clerk on completion of ten years of service on daily wages basis.

The Labour Court had observed that the employer had regularized the respondent as a Chowkidar with effect from 5.7.1997, which was refused by him. Thereafter, the engagement as daily wager was terminated. This order was challenged before the Industrial Disputes Tribunal, under Section 33, which was dismissed.

The High Court held that the approach of the Labour Court was wrong as it introduced concepts which are unnecessary. The High Court noted that there was no dispute that the respondent was employed as a clerk.

In light of these facts and precedents, it appears that the challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court by which two Writ Petitions filed by the respondent were disposed of.

As per document C113, State of Himachal Pradesh and Another v Ravinder Singh (2008), the Supreme Court held that the claim for regularization was not maintainable as no appointment order was issued and the case of the respondent was not sponsored by the employment exchange. The court also noted that the claim for equal work for equal pay was not maintainable as daily-rated persons were not required to perform duties at par with those in regular service.

As per document C663, G.M., B.S.N.L. & Ors. v Mahesh Chand (2008), the Supreme Court held that the termination of the respondent's services was illegal and he is entitled to be reinstated with continuity in service but without back wages.

As per document C2068, Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Limited v Mohammed Rafi (2009), the Supreme Court held that the termination of the workman's services was illegal and he is entitled to be reinstated with full back wages and continuity of service.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the respondent has a strong case for regularization as a clerk on completion of ten years of service on daily wages basis.

QUERY: AILA_Q22
BASED ON: C2373, C2169, C1126
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2373, C2169, and C1126, I will provide an answer to your query.

The user's query is about the legal acceptability of a judgment and order passed by the High Court, which endorsed the judgment passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge. The judgment imposed a sentence of rigorous imprisonment on the appellants for various offences related to dowry harassment and suicide.

To address this query, I will rely on the relevant precedents and statutes mentioned in the provided documents.

Document C2373 (K.V. Prakash Babu v State of Karnataka) deals with the issue of conviction under Section 306 IPC (Abetment of suicide) and Sections 302 and 498-A IPC (Murder and Dowry Death). The Supreme Court held that the husband's conviction under Section 306 IPC was annulled, but he was found guilty of the offence under Section 498-A IPC. This precedent highlights the importance of considering the evidence brought on record and the exposition of law in the field.

Document C2169 (Ravindra Trimbak Patil v State of Maharashtra) concerns a case where the husband was convicted under Sections 306 and 498A IPC for dowry harassment and suicide. The Supreme Court partly allowed the criminal appeal, confirming the conviction but reducing the sentence.

Document C1126 (Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board v Indraprastha Gas Limited and others) is unrelated to the issue at hand, as it deals with regulatory matters under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 2008.

In light of these precedents, I would argue that the judgment and order passed by the High Court are legally acceptable. The High Court's endorsement of the Additional Sessions Judge's judgment was based on a thorough analysis of the evidence presented in court. The prosecution had established that the appellants had inflicted unbearable torture on the deceased, causing mental harassment and ultimately leading to her suicide.

The precedents cited above emphasize the importance of considering the evidence brought on record and the exposition of law in the field. In this case, the High Court's judgment was based on a careful evaluation of the prosecution's evidence, which showed that the appellants had committed dowry harassment and caused the deceased's death.

Therefore, I conclude that the judgment and order passed by the High Court are legally acceptable, as they were based on a thorough analysis of the evidence presented in court and were consistent with relevant precedents and statutes.

QUERY: AILA_Q23
BASED ON: C2176, C2427, C1094
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2176, C2427, and C1094...

The petitioners' request for an order in the nature of mandamus to direct the State of Haryana to revalidate the licence/permission granted by the Director by his letter dated 'Nil' Memo No. 1823-5 DP-84 permitting the petitioner to construct multi-storeyed houses and flats in accordance with law by accepting security/bank guarantee to the tune of Rs 109.30 lakhs as demanded by the respondent appears to be a valid one.

In Mannalal Jain v State of Assam and Others (C2176), the Supreme Court held that when an application is rejected, it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application under the new rules or regulations. Similarly, in Tripura Goods Transport Association & Anr v Commissioner Of Taxes & Ors (C2427), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of certain amendments to the Tripura Sales Tax Act and Rules, which imposed additional formalities on transporters.

In Kanti Lal Babulal v H. C. Patel (C1094), the Supreme Court held that a provision in the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1946, which required dealers to furnish proof of refunding an amount paid to them within a certain period was violative of Article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.

Considering these precedents, it appears that the petitioners' request for revalidation of the licence/permission granted by the Director is not barred by any statute or regulation. The petitioners have consistently demonstrated their willingness to comply with the conditions laid down by the respondent and have made efforts to arrange for the bank guarantee as demanded.

Therefore, I recommend that the court grant the petitioners' request for an order in the nature of mandamus to direct the State of Haryana to revalidate the licence/permission granted by the Director.

QUERY: AILA_Q24
BASED ON: C2838, C547, C494
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2838, C547, and C494, I will provide an answer to your query.

The appeals are directed against the judgment of a High Court whereby an appeal and a criminal revision were disposed of. The appellants were found guilty and sentenced to undergo various terms of sentences. The Criminal Appeal was filed by three appellants questioning the conviction and sentence as recorded. Complainant filed a revision petition stating that she was entitled to compensation.

The background facts giving rise to the trial are essentially as follows: The complainant and the appellants are first cousins, and as such are closely related to each other. Their grandfather was P1. As per site plans Ex. PP prepared by P2, P3, and PW4, and Ex. PT prepared by P3, PW9 (I.O.), it shows that the place of occurrence was in the common land owned both by the appellants and the complainant party.

The trial court took note of the fact that the appellants and the members of the complainant party are related to each other closely. The dispute arose because of conflicting claims as to the ownership of the land. It was submitted that the occurrence took place when the members of the complainant party came forward and obstructed the appellant from doing the work and restrained them from pulling out the pipe.

In essence, it was submitted that the accused were exercising the right of private defence or in the alternative the occurrence took place in the course of a sudden quarrel. The stand of the State was that there appears to be some exchange of words. The trial court found substance in the plea and found the accused persons guilty.

Before the High Court, it was submitted that the factual scenario has not been correctly appreciated by the trial court. It noted that the appellants pulled out the iron and plastic pipes which were installed on the land jointly owned by both the parties. Since the accused persons pulled out the pipes, it was natural that the members of the complainant party who were standing at a distance of 16 to 35 feet from the appellants intervened and asked them not to pull out the pipes unless the elders take a decision.

The appellants did not pay any heed. The medical evidence also corroborates the statements given by the eye witnesses. Dr. D1 (PW 1) has stated in his testimony, that on examining P5 he found that he had received one incised wound injury on the scalp left parietal area vertical in position.

Similarly, on examining P6, he found the first injury to be an incised wound. Second and third were abrasions on the left shoulder and neck. The fourth injury was a lacerated wound on the right parietal area of scalp. On the post-mortem conducted on P4, an incised wound was found on the parietal area of the scalp, about 12 cms from right ear pinna backwards, traversing part of left parietal area of scalp to left occipital area.

The medical evidence corroborates the ocular account.

QUERY: AILA_Q25
BASED ON: C1574, C1238, C1552
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1574, C1238, and C1552, I will provide an answer to your query.

The appeals involving common questions of law and fact were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment. The lands situated inter alia in villages V1, V2, V3, and V4 were acquired by the State for the purpose of use thereof by the Appellant.

In doing so, several deeds of sale executed between 1981 and 1982 in respect of lands adjoining some of the villages were taken into consideration and market value of the land was determined at the rate of Rs. 1.55 per sq. m. The claimants Respondents did not accept the said award and prayed for a reference to the Civil Court.

The Reference Court purported to be relying on or on the basis of judgments dated 30th October, 1996 and 10th November, 1996 passed by 4th Extra Assistant Judge and 2nd Extra Assistant Judge respectively in L.A. R. Case No. 1349/92 and 1314/92.

The Appellant herein was not impleaded as a party in the Reference Court. It had, thus, no opportunity also to adduce any evidence either before the Land Acquisition Collector or before the Reference Court.

It is noted that the Supreme Court of India has laid down principles regarding the determination of market value of land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. In Hussein Ghadially @ M.H.G.A Shaikh and others v State of Gujarat (C1574), it was held that the court should consider all relevant material, including the deeds of sale executed between 1981 and 1982.

In State Of U.P. & Ors v Jasvir Singh & Ors. (C1238), this Court observed that since the appeals were old, the High Court will have to take steps to dispose the appeals expeditiously.

In Noorul Huda Maqbool Ahmed v Ram Deo Tyagi and others (C1552), it was held that the court should consider all relevant material, including the deeds of sale executed between 1981 and 1982.

Based on these principles, I would hold that the Reference Court acted illegally and without jurisdiction in passing the said judgment solely on the basis of the deposition of one P1 who alleged that the agricultural lands which he and others had been cultivating were of high fertility and three crops in a year were grown therein. The witness further alleged that the village was well-developed.

The Appellant herein was not impleaded as a party in the Reference Court. It had, thus, no opportunity also to adduce any evidence either before the Land Acquisition Collector or before the Reference Court.

Therefore, I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment passed by the Reference Court.

QUERY: AILA_Q26
BASED ON: C64, C1808, C2639
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C64, C1808, and C2639, it is clear that the present case involves an arbitration award made by a former Judge of this Court who was appointed as the sole arbitrator to adjudicate upon the disputes between the parties.

The relevant statutes or precedents cited in these documents are:

* Document C64: Union of India v Prafulla Kumar Samal and Another (1978) - This case deals with the discharge of respondents under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
* Document C1808: Neelakantan And Bros. Construction v Superintending Engineer, National Highways, Salem And Ors. (1988) - This case involves a dispute regarding the jurisdiction of an arbitrator and whether he can proceed with the arbitration despite being transferred.
* Document C2639: Indian Farmers Fertilizer Co-operative Limited v Bhadra Products (2018) - This case deals with the issue of limitation in an arbitration award and whether it can be set aside under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

In light of these precedents, the present case involves an arbitration award made by a former Judge of this Court who was appointed as the sole arbitrator to adjudicate upon the disputes between the parties. The award was challenged before us now, and we need to consider whether it is valid or not.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q27
BASED ON: C2712, C136, C2351
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2712, C136, and C2351, it appears that the Appellant's detention was unlawful. 

Firstly, document C2712 (Abdul Razak Dawood Dhanani v Union of India and others) sets a precedent for the requirement of considering representations made by the detenu before confirming an order of detention. The Supreme Court in this case held that the detaining authority must consider the representation made by the detenu and not simply reject it without giving any reasons. 

Secondly, document C136 (Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah v State of Gujarat and Others) highlights the importance of considering the material documents placed before the detaining authority while passing an order of detention. The Supreme Court in this case emphasized that the detaining authority must consider all relevant materials and not just rely on a single piece of evidence.

Thirdly, document C2351 (K.P.M. Basheer Etc. v State Of Karnataka And Anr. Etc.) sets a precedent for the requirement of considering the reasons given by the detaining authority while passing an order of detention. The Supreme Court in this case held that the High Court must consider the reasons given by the detaining authority and not simply dismiss the petition without giving any reasons.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the Appellant's detention was unlawful because:

1. The detaining authority did not consider the representations made by the Appellant before confirming the order of detention.
2. The material documents placed before the detaining authority were not considered while passing the order of detention.
3. The reasons given by the detaining authority for passing the order of detention were not satisfactory.

Therefore, it is recommended that the Appellant's appeal be allowed and his detention be declared unlawful.
--------------------------------------------------

QUERY: AILA_Q28
BASED ON: C2061, C325, C223
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2061, C325, and C223, I would like to address your query.

The challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the High Court dismissing the appeal filed by the appellants. The appeal was directed against the judgment dated 31st August 2004 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge convicting the appellants for an offence and sentencing each to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs. 2000/- with default stipulation.

The background facts are as follows: On 27th December 2000, at about 11:00 a.m., one P1 made a complaint to the officer in charge of the Police Station that at about 6:00 a.m. on the same day P3 s/o P4, P5 S/o P6, and P7 s/o P3 along with two others assaulted his brother P2 with spears thereby severely injuring him while he was ploughing the field.

In the context of these documents, it is relevant to note that in E. Balakrishnama Naidu v State of Andhra Pradesh and another (C2061), the Supreme Court held that the concession made by the Additional Public Prosecutor before the trial court regarding the evidence not dealing with any of the ingredients required to establish the charges cannot be sustained against the accused.

Similarly, in Para Seenaiah and another v State of Andhra Pradesh and another (C325), the Supreme Court observed that degenerate village politics has turned violent to claim a valuable human life. The prosecution story is that out of two factions in village Nagulavellatur one was led by Para Braimaiah while the other was championed by Bodduluru Rathanam.

In Dinesh Tiwari v State of Uttar Pradesh and others (C223), the Supreme Court held that the High Court dismissed the application filed by the accused under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge framing the charge against the accused for the offence u/s 302, 323, 504, and 506 IPC.

In light of these precedents, it is essential to consider whether the concession made by the Additional Public Prosecutor before the trial court regarding the evidence not dealing with any of the ingredients required to establish the charges can be sustained against the accused. Additionally, the Supreme Court's observations in Para Seenaiah and another v State of Andhra Pradesh and another (C325) highlight the importance of considering the background facts and the prosecution story.

Furthermore, in Dinesh Tiwari v State of Uttar Pradesh and others (C223), the Supreme Court emphasized the need to consider the factual matrix of the case, including the reasons for enmity and the detail event of murder mentioned in the FIR.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of documents C2061, C325, and C223, it is essential to carefully consider the concession made by the Additional Public Prosecutor before the trial court regarding the evidence not dealing with any of the ingredients required to establish the charges. Additionally, the Supreme Court's observations in Para Seenaiah and another v State of Andhra Pradesh and another (C325) highlight the importance of considering the background facts and the prosecution story.

QUERY: AILA_Q29
BASED ON: C1143, C364, C403
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1143, C364, and C403, I would like to address your query.

The appeal before us is against the judgment and order dated 5.8.2008 passed by the High Court reversing the judgment of acquittal dated 8.4.2003 recorded by the Sessions Court wherein the appellant was charge-sheeted for murdering his wife, P1, by giving her Sodium Cyanide.

In this case, the prosecution examined 21 witnesses in support of its case. The Trial Court disbelieved the prosecution witnesses and acquitted the appellant vide judgment and order dated 8.4.2003. However, the High Court considered the submissions made by the prosecution that the appreciation of evidence by learned Sessions Judge was not proper one, thus, the findings of fact recorded by the Trial Court were perverse.

The circumstances proved ruled out the possibility of suicide. The medical evidence proved beyond doubt that the deceased died of Cyanide poisoning. Nobody except the appellant had procured the Cyanide poison and the appellant had persuaded the deceased P1 to take it under the garb of it being an oral contraceptive.

In light of the above, I would like to cite relevant statutes and precedents:

* Section 302 IPC: Punishment for murder.
* Section 201 IPC: Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to conceal offence.
* Section 498A IPC: Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.

In the case of R. Shaji v State Of Kerala (Document ID: C1143), the Supreme Court held that "the appreciation of evidence by the Trial Court was not proper one" and that the findings of fact recorded by the Trial Court were perverse.

In the case of Harendra Nath Chakraborty v State Of West Bengal (Document ID: C364), the Supreme Court held that "the court may, for any adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than three months."

In the case of State of Karnataka v K. Gopalakrishna (Document ID: C403), the Supreme Court held that "the respondent was found guilty of the offence under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for life."

Based on these precedents, I would argue that the High Court's judgment reversing the Trial Court's acquittal is reasonable and justified. The evidence presented by the prosecution proves beyond doubt that the appellant had procured the Cyanide poison and persuaded P1 to take it under the garb of an oral contraceptive, which resulted in her death.

Therefore, I would recommend upholding the High Court's judgment and rejecting the appeal.

QUERY: AILA_Q30
BASED ON: C1648, C2114, C2520
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1648, C2114, and C2520, it appears that the deceased P1's case is similar to the cases discussed in these judgments.

In Narayan Manikrao Salgar and others v State Of Maharashtra (C1648), the Supreme Court held that the prosecution can rely on circumstantial evidence to prove its case. The court also emphasized the importance of considering the entire evidence, including the dying declaration, to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.

In Donthula Ravindranath @ Ravinder Rao v State of Andhra Pradesh (C2114), the Supreme Court confirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellant for the offence under Section 302 IPC. The court relied on circumstantial evidence, including the extra-judicial confession made by the accused, to establish his guilt.

In Naval Kishore v State of Maharashtra (C2520), the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellant for the offences under Sections 498A, 302, and 201 IPC. The court considered the entire evidence, including the dying declaration, to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.

Based on these judgments, it appears that the prosecution in P1's case can rely on circumstantial evidence, including any dying declarations made by her, to prove its case against the respondents-accused. The court will need to consider the entire evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.

It is worth noting that the judgments discussed above are not directly applicable to P1's case, as they involve different facts and circumstances. However, they do provide guidance on the principles of law that may be relevant in this case.

The appeal before this Court is directed against the judgment and order dated 26.5.2006 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court whereby the learned Single Judge has allowed the writ petition and set aside the impugned order passed by the Revisional Court and remanded the matter back to the Revisional Court for deciding afresh on the basis of direction given by the Court.

The relevant statutes or precedents that can be cited in this context are:

1. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) - Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 read with Sections 34 and 120B.
2. The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 - Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7.

The documents C427, C1036, and C2638 are relevant in this context as they provide precedents for the interpretation of similar legal issues. For instance, document C427 deals with a case where the High Court set aside an order passed by the Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, Agra, dismissing a complaint filed against the accused for offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, and 471 read with Sections 34 and 120B of the IPC. This precedent can be cited to support the argument that the High Court has the power to set aside an order passed by a Revisional Court.

Similarly, document C1036 deals with a case where the Gujarat High Court dismissed a revision petition filed against an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Balasinor convicting the appellant of the offence under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. This precedent can be cited to support the argument that the High Court has the power to dismiss a revision petition filed against an order passed by a Magistrate.

Document C2638 deals with a case where the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissed a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, which was directed against a judgment and order of a Single Judge of that Court. This precedent can be cited to support the argument that the High Court has the power to dismiss a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of documents C427, C1036, and C2638, it is clear that the appeal before this Court is directed against the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court. The relevant statutes or precedents cited above can be used to support the argument that the High Court has the power to set aside an order passed by a Revisional Court, dismiss a revision petition filed against an order passed by a Magistrate, and dismiss a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution.

QUERY: AILA_Q32
BASED ON: C1869, S143, C2706
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1869, S143, and C2706...

The user's query revolves around a case where the appellants obstructed the way by putting stones and thorny bushes, abused PW.1 and the deceased P3, and then attacked P3 with weapons, leading to his unconsciousness and subsequent removal to the hospital.

In this context, it is essential to consider the relevant statutes and precedents. Document C1869 (Boya Ganganna and Another v State of Andhra Pradesh) provides guidance on the interpretation of Sections 147, 148, 302 read with S. 149 or S. 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

Document S143 (Divorce) is not directly relevant to this case, as it pertains to divorce proceedings rather than criminal law.

Document C2706 (Badri and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh) provides insight into the application of Section 148 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with the offense of rioting. This document highlights the importance of considering the context and circumstances surrounding an incident when determining whether a group of people constitutes an "unlawful assembly" under Section 149.

In light of these documents, it is crucial to examine the evidence presented in this case to determine whether the appellants' actions constitute the offenses with which they were charged. The court must consider the specific circumstances surrounding the obstruction, abuse, and attack on P3, as well as the intentions and motivations of the appellants.

Ultimately, a thorough analysis of the documents and evidence will be necessary to determine the appropriate course of action in this case.

QUERY: AILA_Q33
BASED ON: C552, C2638, C2242
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C552, C2638, and C2242, it appears that the present appeal is against the judgment and order of the High Court dated March 27, 1958, which maintained the conviction of the appellant but reduced the sentence of four years' rigorous imprisonment passed on the appellant by the Special Judge, Kanpur, to two years' rigorous imprisonment.

The relevant statutes or precedents that can be applied in this case are:

* The Indian Penal Code (IPC)
* The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947
* The Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952

In the context of this appeal, the following points can be considered:

1. The appellant was employed as a constable in the Police Department and later became a Head Constable attached to the L1.
2. The charge against him was that he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriated or otherwise converted to his own use many articles, including opium and bottles of liquor, which were seized in connection with excise offenses kept in deposit in the L1.
3. The prosecution alleged that the acts of dishonest misappropriation were committed by the appellant in conspiracy with two other persons, P2 and P3.
4. The Special Judge who tried the case recorded an order of acquittal for P2 and P3 but convicted the appellant on the sole ground that he had failed to account satisfactorily for the possession of Rs. 9,284-1-0, which was disproportionate to his known sources of income.

In light of these facts, it appears that the present appeal is an attempt to challenge the conviction of the appellant and the sentence imposed by the Special Judge. The relevant precedents from documents C552, C2638, and C2242 can be applied to guide the analysis of this case.

For instance, in document C552 (D.D. Suri v Union of India and Another), the Supreme Court held that a public servant cannot be convicted on the sole ground that he has failed to account satisfactorily for his possession of certain assets, unless there is evidence to show that the assets were acquired by him dishonestly or corruptly.

Similarly, in document C2638 (B. D. Gupta v State Of Haryana), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of considering all relevant circumstances before convicting a public servant on charges of corruption.

In document C2242 (Sri. C. I. Emden v State of Uttar Pradesh), the Supreme Court reiterated that the burden of proving corrupt practice lies on the prosecution and that the court must carefully consider all the evidence adduced by both sides before arriving at a conclusion.

Based on these precedents, it appears that the present appeal has some merit and that further analysis is required to determine whether the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant are justified.

QUERY: AILA_Q34
BASED ON: C105, C523, C33
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C105, C523, and C33, I will provide an answer to your query.

The petitioners, who were Members of Parliament at the time of filing the petitions, have alleged large-scale defalcation of public funds and falsification of accounts involving hundreds of crores of rupees in the Department of Animal Husbandry. They have also alleged that attempts have been made to delay and interfere with the judicial process consequent upon a change of government in the Centre.

The petitioners have prayed for several reliefs, including monitoring the conduct of trials relating to fodder scam cases proceedings against respondents 4 and 5, appointing the same prosecutor who had been conducting prosecution earlier, directing the High Court to ensure that no prosecutor or CBI Officer attached with the investigation and trial of the case should be removed, harassed, or victimized for discharging their duties, providing at least one inspector for each fodder case, cancellation of bail granted to respondents 4 and 5, and direction to respondents 1-3 to file an appeal against the orders passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.

In the context of public interest litigation, the petitioners have relied on several precedents. For instance, in N.K. Prasada v Government Of India And Ors. (C105), this Court has held that when a writ petition is filed to monitor the investigation and trial of cases, it is essential to ensure that the process is fair, impartial, and free from any influence or pressure.

In Mohammed Anis v Union Of India (C523), this Court has emphasized the importance of an independent investigation agency in ensuring the credibility of the investigation. The Court has held that when there are allegations of wrongdoing by the local police, it is necessary to hand over the investigation to an independent agency like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to ensure that the investigation is fair and impartial.

In Kazilhendup Dorji v Central Bureau Of Investigation (C33), this Court has considered the question of withdrawal of consent given by the State Government under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. The Court has held that when a member of the Delhi Special Police Establishment is enabled to exercise powers and jurisdiction for the investigation of specified offences in any area in the State, it is essential to ensure that the withdrawal of consent does not affect matters pending investigation on the basis of such consent on the date of withdrawal.

In light of these precedents, I would advise that this Court should monitor the trial of the case pending before the Special Judge, CBI, and take all necessary steps to ensure that the process is fair, impartial, and free from any influence or pressure. The petitioners' allegations against respondents 4 and 5 should be investigated thoroughly, and appropriate action should be taken to prevent any interference with the judicial process.

QUERY: AILA_Q35
BASED ON: C2590, C444, C2779
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2590, C444, and C2779, I will provide an answer to your query.

The user's query is about two appellants, who are brothers, along with their father P1, being prosecuted for an offence. The prosecution case is that the appellants have a sweetmeat shop in L1, and there was an altercation between them and witness P2 on April 18, 1980. On that day, deceased P4 accompanied by PW P5 visited the house of witness P2 to settle the details of the marriage that was to be performed in the near future. At about 10:00 p.m., deceased P4 and PW P5 left the house of witness P2, and all three saw the two appellants and P1 standing in front of their shop. When they reached the bazar locality, the appellants and P1 raised charges, and P1 exhorted the appellants to catch hold of witness P2. The first appellant gave a blow with a dagger on the left side of the chest of deceased P4, who fell down on the ground.

The relevant statutes or precedents that can be applied in this case are:

* Section 302 IPC (document C2590)
* Section 34 IPC (document C2590 and C444)
* Section 201 IPC (document C2590)

In document C2590, the Supreme Court of India held that the appellant's conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC was correct. The court observed that the evidence of two witnesses P2 and P6 was reliable and bore out a part of the statement made by the first appellant.

In document C444, the Supreme Court of India confirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting the appellant under Section 302 IPC and sentencing him to imprisonment for life. The court held that the prosecution had established the case beyond reasonable doubt.

In document C2779, the Supreme Court of India convicted the appellants under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them to imprisonment for life. The court observed that the evidence of the witnesses was reliable and bore out a part of the statement made by one of the accused persons.

Based on these precedents, it can be argued that the prosecution has established the case beyond reasonable doubt, and the appellants' conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC is correct.

QUERY: AILA_Q36
BASED ON: C821, C2346, C1599
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C821, C2346, and C1599, the following interpretation and application of Medical Benefit Rules applicable in States S1 and S2 can be made:

The Medical Benefit Rules in both states provide for reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by government employees. In State S1, the rules specify a ceiling of Rs. 39,207/- for reimbursement of medical expenses, which was sanctioned to the respondent in the first case.

In State S2, the rules also have a ceiling on reimbursement of medical expenses, but it is not specified in the documents provided. However, based on the principles laid down in documents C821 and C2346, it can be inferred that the Medical Benefit Rules in State S2 also provide for reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by government employees.

In both states, the Medical Benefit Rules provide for reimbursement of medical expenses subject to certain conditions and ceilings. The rules are intended to ensure that government employees receive necessary medical treatment without financial burden.

The Supreme Court judgments in documents C821 and C2346 reiterate the importance of ensuring that government employees receive necessary medical treatment without financial burden. In document C1599, the court held that the fixation of price pursuant to the provisions of the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1995 was not the contentious issue before it.

In light of these judgments, the Medical Benefit Rules in States S1 and S2 should be interpreted to provide for reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by government employees subject to certain conditions and ceilings. The rules are intended to ensure that government employees receive necessary medical treatment without financial burden.

Therefore, based on the analysis of documents C821, C2346, and C1599, it can be concluded that the Medical Benefit Rules in States S1 and S2 provide for reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by government employees subject to certain conditions and ceilings.

QUERY: AILA_Q37
BASED ON: C1213, C448, C47
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C1213, C448, and C47, I will answer your query.

The appellants are challenging the legality of the judgment rendered by the High Court upholding their conviction and sentence imposed by the trial Court. The background facts leading to the trial of the accused appellants are as follows: The case was registered on the basis of information lodged by P1 (PW-6), which was recorded on 10.11.1989 at about 2.00 a.m.

The prosecution's version is based on the testimonies of relatives, including P1 (PW-6) and P3 (PW-7), who claimed to be eyewitnesses to the incident. The trial Court found the accused persons guilty and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months, two years, and seven years respectively with separate fines for each of the alleged offences.

The appellants' learned counsel submitted that the prosecution version does not inspire confidence due to the delay in lodging the FIR and the reliance on testimonies of relatives. Additionally, it was submitted that the sentences imposed were high.

In K. Ravi Kumar v State of Karnataka (Document ID: C1213), the Supreme Court held that while the trial Court's findings are binding on appeal, they must be based on credible evidence and not merely speculative or conjectural. The Court emphasized that the prosecution's case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and any doubts or uncertainties must be resolved in favor of the accused.

In State Of Rajasthan v Islam (Document ID: C448), the Supreme Court reiterated that while the trial Court's findings are binding on appeal, they must be based on credible evidence and not merely speculative or conjectural. The Court emphasized that the prosecution's case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and any doubts or uncertainties must be resolved in favor of the accused.

In Subash Shiv Shankar v State of Uttar Pradesh (Document ID: C47), the Supreme Court held that while the trial Court's findings are binding on appeal, they must be based on credible evidence and not merely speculative or conjectural. The Court emphasized that the prosecution's case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and any doubts or uncertainties must be resolved in favor of the accused.

In light of these precedents, it is essential to analyze the evidence presented by the prosecution and determine whether it meets the required standards of proof. The trial Court's findings should be based on credible evidence and not merely speculative or conjectural. Any doubts or uncertainties must be resolved in favor of the accused.

Therefore, based on the analysis of documents C1213, C448, and C47, I conclude that the appellants' challenge to the legality of the judgment rendered by the High Court upholding their conviction and sentence imposed by the trial Court is not justified. The prosecution's case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and any doubts or uncertainties must be resolved in favor of the accused.

Recommendation: The appeal should be dismissed as it lacks merit.

QUERY: AILA_Q38
BASED ON: C2729, C372, C961
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2729, C372, and C961, I would like to provide an answer to your query.

The appellant's contention that Clause 19 of the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985 is ultra vires Articles of the Constitution as it does not permit an accused a right to adduce evidence to contradict the report of the public analyst is not tenable. The said clause is intended to ensure the quality control of fertilizers and does not infringe upon the fundamental rights of the accused.

In Rishi Kiran Logistics Private Limited v Board of Trustees of Kandla Port Trust and others (C372), this Court has held that a statutory provision must be construed in accordance with its purpose and object. Similarly, in B. L. Goel v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others (C961), this Court has emphasized the importance of considering the legislative intent behind a particular provision.

In Regional Manager & Anr. v Pawan Kumar Dubey (C2729), this Court has laid down the principle that a statute must be construed in accordance with its purpose and object, and that the courts should not interpret a statutory provision in a manner that would lead to absurd or anomalous consequences.

In light of these precedents, it is clear that Clause 19 of the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985 does not infringe upon the fundamental rights of the accused. The said clause is intended to ensure the quality control of fertilizers and does not permit an accused a right to adduce evidence to contradict the report of the public analyst.

Therefore, I conclude that the appellant's contention that Clause 19 of the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985 is ultra vires Articles of the Constitution as it does not permit an accused a right to adduce evidence to contradict the report of the public analyst is not tenable.

QUERY: AILA_Q39
BASED ON: C2479, C1205, C2529
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2479, C1205, and C2529...

The user's query is about challenging the High Court's order allowing the respondent's appeal against his conviction for murder. The respondent was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life and a fine.

To answer this query, I will analyze the relevant legal precedents and statutes mentioned in the documents provided.

Document C2479 (Sudha Verma v State Of Uttar Pradesh And Another) deals with the issue of bail being granted to an accused person. Although it is not directly related to the case at hand, it highlights the importance of considering the circumstances of each case when granting or denying bail.

Document C1205 (Niemla Textile Finishing. Mills Ltd. v The 2Nd Punjab Industrial Tribunal) is a landmark judgment that deals with the vires of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This document does not provide any direct relevance to the current case, but it may be useful in understanding the concept of jurisdiction and competency.

Document C2529 (Prithipal Singh v Satpal Singh (Dead) Through Its Lrs) is a civil appeal that deals with the issue of setting aside an ex-parte order for eviction. Although this document does not directly relate to the current case, it may provide some insights on the concept of jurisdiction and competency.

In the context of the user's query, the relevant legal precedents and statutes are:

* Section 302 IPC (Indian Penal Code) deals with the offense of murder.
* The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides guidelines for the admissibility of evidence in a court of law.
* The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 outlines the procedures for investigating and trying criminal cases.

Based on these documents and legal precedents, it is essential to carefully analyze the circumstances surrounding the alleged crime, including the investigation, the gathering of evidence, and the trial proceedings. The High Court's order allowing the respondent's appeal against his conviction should be reviewed in light of these factors.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of documents C2479, C1205, and C2529, it is crucial to consider the relevant legal precedents and statutes when challenging a High Court's order allowing an accused person's appeal against their conviction. A thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the alleged crime, including the investigation, evidence gathering, and trial proceedings, is essential in determining whether the High Court's decision was justified.

QUERY: AILA_Q40
BASED ON: C2814, C2334, C1475
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2814, C2334, and C1475, I would like to provide my answer as follows:

The respondent herein, having been selected by the Public Service Commission, was appointed as Law Officer-cum-Draftsman in the Directorate of Cooperation. The High Court directed that at least two promotional avenues be provided to him, with the graded scale consisting of three grades: Grade III (initially being the Post of Law Officer-cum-Draftsman), Grade II, and Grade I (Officer of Judicial Service). The direction further specified that the scale of pay of Grade II Law Officer-cum-Draftsman shall be same as Grade-II officer of the Judicial Service, and the scale of pay of Grade-I Law Officer-cum-Draftsman shall be equal to the scale of pay of Grade-I officer of Judicial Service.

The appellants question this direction, contending that the High Court went wrong in issuing such a direction. They argue that the respondent did not have any legal right to be promoted to a higher post, far less the right to get the scale of pay of Grade I officer of the Judicial Service. Such a direction by the High Court is wholly without jurisdiction.

In this context, it would be relevant to consider the following precedents:

1. In R.S. Garg v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others (C2814), the Supreme Court held that an appointment made on ad hoc basis cannot be considered as regular appointment unless the selection process provided for in the rules is followed.
2. In Baswant Shankarappa Swami v State Of Maharashtra & Ors. (C2334), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of a rule providing for promotion to a higher post based on experience and qualifications, despite the appellant's contention that it was arbitrary and unreasonable.
3. In Union of India and Others v Pradip Kumar Dey (C1475), the Supreme Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work is not applicable in all cases, and that the duties performed by an employee may be more hazardous than those performed by another employee with similar qualifications and experience.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the High Court's direction to provide at least two promotional avenues to the respondent, including a graded scale with three grades, is not entirely without jurisdiction. The direction seems to be based on the principle of equal pay for equal work, which was upheld in C1475. However, the appellants' contention that the respondent did not have any legal right to be promoted to a higher post may require further consideration and analysis.

Ultimately, the correctness or otherwise of the High Court's direction would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the applicable laws and regulations.

QUERY: AILA_Q41
BASED ON: C2590, C1570, C2421
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C2590, C1570, and C2421, I will provide my answer.

The Appellant calls in question the legality of the judgment rendered by the High Court confirming his conviction for the offence and sentence of imprisonment for life as awarded by the learned Sessions Judge. The background facts as unfolded during trial by the prosecution are essentially as follows:

One P1 (hereinafter referred to as the 'deceased') was having an industry, and he employed a number of girls. The accused used to make fun of the girls/workers outside the factory and this was objected to by the deceased several times. On that score, there had been enmity between the deceased and the accused.

At about 8:30 p.m. on 1.5.1990, PW-1, PW-2, and one P2 were standing in front of L1 ground, south of Mail Road. The accused was sitting on the eastern side of a culvert. There was a tube light burning, and hence there was enough light at that place. At that time, the deceased, who came in a bicycle proceeding from east to west, took a turn towards south. The accused rushed to the deceased saying "you die, old man" and hit him with a stick (M.O.1) on his head.

The deceased sustained injuries, and there was profuse bleeding. PW-1, PW-2, and P2 immediately went near him and when the accused saw them coming near ran towards west, leaving the weapon viz., M.O.1 stick. Thereafter, PW-1, PW-2, P2, and the wife of the deceased took the deceased to the Government Hospital.

After giving first aid to the deceased, the doctors in the said hospital advised to take the deceased to L2 for further treatment. The aforementioned persons thereafter took the deceased to L2 and at the Government Hospital, the deceased was treated by Doctor D1 (PW-6). The doctor found several injuries. PW-1 narrated the incident to the Head Constable (PW-10) at the police station who recorded the first information report (Ex.P-11).

The same was dispatched to the Court of Judicial Magistrate. On postmortem, 6 injuries were noticed, out of which 3 were external and the rest were internal. Injuries 1 and 2 as noticed were abrasions, but the fatal injury i.e., injury No.3 was stated to be a 4" linear oblique sutured wound over the right parietal scalp.

The doctor opined that the injury was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death. On 4.5.1990, the accused was arrested and after completion of investigation, the charge sheet was placed. The accused pleaded innocence.

In the light of the above facts and circumstances, it is necessary to consider whether the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court are justified or not. In this regard, reference may be made to the judgments in documents C2590, C1570, and C2421.

Document C2590 (Baikuntha Nath Chaudhury v State of Orissa) lays down that the court should carefully scrutinize the evidence and consider the entire material on record before arriving at a conclusion. It further holds that the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court are justified if the evidence is cogent, credible, and reliable.

Document C1570 (Sundaramurthy v State of Tamil Nadu) emphasizes the importance of considering the totality of the circumstances and the entire material on record before arriving at a conclusion. It further holds that the court should not lightly interfere with the findings of the trial Court unless there is a manifest error or a miscarriage of justice.

Document C2421 (Dnyanu Hariba Mali and Others v State of Maharashtra) lays down that the court should carefully examine the evidence and consider the entire material on record before arriving at a conclusion. It further holds that the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court are justified if the evidence is cogent, credible, and reliable.

In light of these judgments, it appears that the High Court has correctly analyzed the evidence and considered the entire material on record before confirming the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court. The findings of the trial Court are based on the testimony of eye witnesses PWs. 1, 2, and 3, which is cogent, credible, and reliable.

Therefore, in my opinion, the judgment rendered by the High Court confirming the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court is justified and should be upheld.

QUERY: AILA_Q42
BASED ON: C805, C912, C2638
ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of documents C805, C912, and C2638, I would like to provide the following answer:

The appeal arises out of the judgment dated 23.8.2016 passed by the High Court, which dismissed the petition filed by the appellant. The records reveal that the parents of the appellant entered into an agreement to sell with Respondent No.2 on 14.1.1997 for a sale consideration of Rs.33,50,000/-. The parents received earnest money of Rs.6,50,101/- and the remaining amount was to be paid at the time of registration of the sale deed.

The appellant denies receiving the earnest money of Rs.6,50,101/- by his parents. It appears that the transaction for the agreement to sell was not completed, and a civil suit in this regard is pending. Respondent No.2 lodged a complaint before the police authorities making allegations of cheating, breach of trust, etc., against the parents of the appellant as well as the appellant, which came to be registered as FIR No.03/2016.

The appellant moved an application before the High Court for quashing the proceedings against him and the same came to be dismissed by the impugned judgment.

In this context, it is relevant to refer to the precedents laid down in documents C805, C912, and C2638.

Document C805 (Pawan Kumar Ralli v Maninder Singh Narula) lays down that a complaint must be filed within a period of one month after the expiry of 15 days of receipt of the notice dated 27th April, 2012. If the complaint is not filed within this time limit, it would be barred by limitation.

Document C912 (Vijayander Kumar and others v State of Rajasthan and another) lays down that an agreement for transfer of management, assets, and liabilities of a company must be in writing and signed by all parties concerned. The informant did not agree to the transfer of management without taking him into confidence.

Document C2638 (B. D. Gupta v State Of Haryana) lays down that a disciplinary proceeding under the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952 must be conducted fairly and in accordance with the rules. The appellant's petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India was dismissed by the High Court.

In light of these precedents, it appears that the High Court's judgment dismissing the petition filed by the appellant is not flawed.
